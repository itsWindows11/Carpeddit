## Contributing

### Looking for issues to work on?

Issues marked `triage approved` are a good place to start.

You can also check the `help wanted` tag to find other issues to help with.

If you're interested in working on a fix, leave a comment to let everyone know and to help avoid duplicated effort from others.

### Rules

1. **DO** make sure your issue exists before submitting a new one. Your issue might be closed if it's a duplicate.
2. **DO** write a good description for your pull request. More detail is better. Describe why the change is being made and why you have chosen a particular solution. Describe any manual testing you performed to validate your change.
3. **DO** check for additional occurrences of the same problem in other parts of the codebase before submitting your PR.
4. **DO NOT** submit a PR unless it is linked to an Issue marked triage approved. This enables us to have a discussion on the idea before anyone invests time in an implementation.
5. **DO NOT** merge multiple changes into one PR unless they have the same root cause.
6. **DO NOT** submit pure formatting/typo changes to code that has not been modified otherwise.
